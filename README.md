- "Today's programming wisdom is to embrace simplicity and readability in your code. Strive to write clean, concise, and well-organized code that is easy to understand and maintain. Remember that code is read more often than it is written, so make it a joy to read for yourself and your fellow developers. Use meaningful variable names, comments, and whitespace to enhance readability. Avoid unnecessary complexity and冗余代码. Finally, always keep in mind the principles of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)."
